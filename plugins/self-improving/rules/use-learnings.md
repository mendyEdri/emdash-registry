# Use Learnings

Before starting any task, consult the learnings files to apply accumulated knowledge.

## Loading Learnings

Check these files for relevant context:

1. **semantic.md** - Facts and preferences
   - User style preferences
   - Codebase conventions
   - Technology choices

2. **procedural.md** - Action patterns
   - "When X, do Y" rules
   - Required checks before actions
   - Workflow patterns

3. **episodes.md** - Past outcomes
   - What worked and why
   - What failed and why
   - Lessons from corrections

## Application

- Match current task type to relevant learnings
- Apply user preferences consistently
- Avoid repeating documented mistakes
- Follow established patterns for similar situations

## Priority

When learnings conflict with general best practices:
- User preferences take priority for style/formatting
- Safety/security best practices take priority over preferences
- Recent learnings supersede older ones (check dates)
